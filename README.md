A sprinkle for the UserFrosting framework to show visual charts of account information

This sprinkle adds bar and pie charts into the standard Userfrosting administration screens. The charts show up automatically when you click on any of the following adminstration options from the left navigation area:
* Users
* Activities
* Roles
* Permissions
* Groups

There are several chart options displayed in near the top of each page.
